# Description
Know if you have an object image and need to classify this object so yo can use an open cv library in python to do it , So in our project we use openCv library and web cam to classify the PS4 and XBOX games , the web cam will show the photo and will detect some points in the web cam image then compare this points with points of an image which saves in our code .


# Steps before coding
First thing we need to add some library the first library is OpenCv . OpenCV can be directly downloaded and installed with the use of pip (package manager). To install OpenCV, just go to the command-line and type the following command:


pip install opencv-python

Second thing we need to add is numpy library With Pip set up, you can use its command line for installing NumPy.

pip install numpy

Then a image query file which contains a images which will be saved in code will be find here:
Hint : You will find the image query file in the repo, you can also download it from google drive using the following link:

# Python code:
Hint : You will find the code in the repo, you can also download it from google drive using the following link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mIwO7bAnQFMmbVugGofo5anwJF6W99n7/view?usp=sharing
